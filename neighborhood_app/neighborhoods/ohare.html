                        <p>O'Hare, located on the far northwest side of Chicago, Illinois, is one of the city's 77 official community areas. O'Hare International Airport is located within the boundaries of this community area. This community area is the
                            only one that extends outside Cook County; the western edge (an area comprising the southwest part of the airport) is in DuPage County. The area is a transportation hub containing O'Hare International Airport as well as major
                            roads such as Interstate 90, its auxiliary Interstate 190, Interstate 294, Illinois Route 72, Illinois Route 171, U.S. Route 12 and U.S. Route 45. This allows the O'Hare neighborhood, combined with the nearby suburb of Rosemont,
                            to work as an edge city.</p>
